Open terminal of your choosing.
Create three groups: group1, group2, shared (GID 9999).
Create two users: user1 (UID: 1001, primary group: group1), user2 (UID: 1002, primary group: group2).
Add user1 and user2 to shared group.
With the help of sudo or su commands create file /tmp/test containing word "Hello" with user1.
Remove public read permissions on the file using chmod 640 /tmp/test command
Using user2 attempt to read /tmp/test file contents.
Change ownership of file using chown user1:shared /tmp/test command.
Using user2 attempt to read /tmp/test file contents.

Self-review:

user2 is able to /tmp/test file contents after ownership change.

uid=1001(user1) gid=10000(group1) groups=10000(group1),9999(shared)

id user2 command returns the following output (ignore group2 gid):
