Open terminal of your choosing.
Using text editor of your choosing create two files named script and script.sh both with the following content:
#!/bin/bash

echo Hello

Make files executable by running chmod +x script script.sh command.
Create a soft link called script_soft for file script.
Create a hard link called script_hard for file script.sh.
Execute both script_soft and script_hard files.
Remove original files script and script.sh.
Execute both script_soft and script_hard files.
Remove all created files.
Self-review:

When executing files "Hello" message should be printed out into your terminal.
After removing the original files, trying to execute soft link should print an error.
